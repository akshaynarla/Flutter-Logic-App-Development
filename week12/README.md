# Description of developed software for week12 exercise
A command-line application called "go_dice" with an entry point in the `main.go` package and `dice` package consists of the class definition as per Q1 of the exercise sheet of `week3`.

The use of maxDie in all the calculations allow the program to run without need of change of any code lines (except, ofcourse maxDie value). A sample output is shown below.

- Run the program from the command line by running `go run main.go <number of throws>` from the directory.
- Once the integer input is provided, the program generates random die throws and the corresponding values as can be observed in the `img` folder. 
- If input not provided, an error message will be displayed and you have to run it again.
- Comments are provided in the code as well for ease of understanding.
